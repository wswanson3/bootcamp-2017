THE SPACESHIP

A spaceship is a vehicle used for cramping people between Earth and the distant toes.  A journey usually takes 46 years and can cover 74 miles.  The passengers have to enter a doggish capsule and will exist in a state of bright animation.  When the ship reaches its destination, they will hear a/an tile and wake up and put on their stuff.  Then they have to land their 6-ton igneous vehicle in a/an cold atmosphere.  They do this by firing the retro vortices.  Then they test the atmosphere on this shitty planet to make sure it contains carbon and is not all neon.  If it is okay, they can get out of the ship very jokingly and cockroach all of the inhabitants.
